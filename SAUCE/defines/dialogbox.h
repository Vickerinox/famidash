    Character table:
    
    BrC*| BlC*| What is
    ' ' |  $  | Space
    0-9 | --- | Numbers
    a-z | A-Z | ASCII
     /  |  \\ | Forward slash
     %  |  &  | Percentage sign
     :  |  ;  | Colon
    --- | ( ) | Black BG rounding characters
    --- |  *  | Star

    *BrC = Brown BG Character, BlC = Black BG character

    Escape characters:
    \a  - Include a substring (its address has to have been pushed to the C stack)
    \b  - Replaces the entire line with Black BG characters, rewinds to the beginning
    \n  - Jumps to the beginning of the next line
    \t  - Skip the next few characters, the byte right after this indicates the amount
    \v  - Skip the next few lines and jump to the beginning, the byte right after this indicates the amount
    \0 (automatically done by cc65) - End of string

    How to include arguments:
    \a  - use include_nested_dialog_string(the ptr to the data). Since this is a stack, you need to include the stirngs in a reverse order
    \t and \v - include the argument byte right after the control code itself. You can either do this in hex ("\0x10" or "\x10") or in octal ("\020" or "\20")
